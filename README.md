# ParrotHunt
Play the game here: http://parrothunt.nergal.se

## Description
ParrotHunt is a ThreeJS WebGL game with a retro "Duck Hunt" feeling (remember the old NES 8-bit game?)

*The code has NOT been polished and is provided "as is". There are a lot of code that are redundant and there are tons of improvements that can be made.*

I haven't had time to create some description of the code layout but if you have any questions, feel free to contact me (nergal@nergal.se).

## Testing

Install nodejs and run *"cd server; nodejs server.js"*. Then point your browser to *http://localhost:8080*
